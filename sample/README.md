# Crescent Sample

This folder contains a sample setup service, issuer, client, and verifier making use of the Crescent system. Note that these components are for demonstration only; they should not be used in production environments.

The sample currently supports two credential types: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and mobile Driver's License (mDL). The issuer can create fresh JWTs but only sample mDLs used by the Crescent library tests can imported in the client. 

The sample is composed of the following components:
* Issuer: a Rocket server that issues JWT tokens; see [`issuer/README.md`](./issuer/README.md).
* Setup Service: a Rocket server that sets up the ZK parameters for all issuers using the same JWT schema; see [setup_service/README.md](./setup_service/README.md).
* Client: a browser extension that stores JWT tokens and presents ZK proofs; see [`client/README.md`](./client/README.md).
* Client Helper: a Rocket server that assists the Client; see [client_helper/README.md](./client_helper/README.md).
* Verifier: a web application that verifies ZK proofs; see [`verifier/README.md`](./verifier/README.md).

Two scripts help with managing the sample projects:
* `./setup-sample.sh`: runs the setup script for (using a default config) and builds the issuer, client_helper, and verifier projects; each must then be started in their own console with `cargo run --release`. The client must be setup and installed separately. 
* `./clean-sample.sh [--data-and-build]`: cleans the data (if the build files too, if the `--data-and-build` flag is passed) for the issuer, client_helper, and verifier projects.

Each component must be setup and modified individually; see their respective README for details. 

# Sample Overview

The sample application illustrates the setup of a Crescent system, and the proof generation and verification from a standard JWT of mDL, mimicking a real-life scenario. Note that security aspects have been overly simplified (e.g., using HTTP over localhost instead of HTTPS, simple username/password user authentication, etc.)

The sample JWT lifecycle is described below, the numeral steps reference this diagram.

<img src="sample_arch.png" alt="Sample Architecture" width="50%">

The *Issuer* is an "unmodified" conventional JWT issuer. It generates a RSA key pair and publishes the public key in a JSON Web Key set at its `.well-known/jwks.json` location. It offers a login and token issuance page (the sample offers two demo users, "alice" and "bob", sharing a password "password").

The *Setup Service* sets up the Crescent parameters. These can be shared by all *Issuers* using the same credential type and schema (identified by a schema UID). The Setup Service calls the `zksetup` library function using an existing JWT or by creating one using dummy claim and signature values (as is the case in our sample [TODO: not up to date, revise]). The resulting parameters are made available at a public endpoint.

Alice visits the Issuer welcome page using a browser with the *Browser Extension* and *Client Helper* installed. She logs in using her username and password, and clicks "Issue token" to get issued a JWT. The browser extension reads the JWT from the HTML page and sends it to the Client Helper which 1) retrieves the corresponding Crescent parameters from the Setup Service, and 2) runs the `prove` library function preparing the JWT for later showing. The proving parameters are stored in the Client Helper and associated with the JWT. A mDL can also be loaded directly into the Browser Extension, in absence of a sample issuance workflow.

Later, Alice visits the *Verifier* page. Her browser extension detects a meta tag indicating a Crescent proof request. She open the extensions and selects the credential to use (matching the requesting type (JWT or mDL) and disclosure capabilities). The Client then generates a showing by calling the `show` library function and sends it to the specified Verifier endpoint. Upon reception, the Verifier downloads the validation parameters from the Setup Service (the first time it sees a presentation for the schema UID) and the Issuer's public key (the first time it sees credential from this Issuer) and calls the `verify` library function. Upon successful proof validation, Alice is granted access. 

# Sample details

The sample defines the following *schema UIDs* expressing the credential type and proof capabilities. (TODO: the client helper should return these values to the browser extension when /prepare is called)

### jwt_corporate_1

* Description: a JWT following the schema used in corporate systems (e.g., Microsoft Entra)
* Credential type: JWT
* Supported disclosure UIDs:
  * `crescent://email_domain`: reveal the domain of an email claim

### mdl_1
* Description: a mobile Driver's License
* Credential type: mDL
* Supported disclosure UIDs
  * `crescent://age_over_21`: reveal that an encoded date of birth makes the user older than 18 years old

## Credential issuance

The following diagram illustrates the credential issuance sequence.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant I as Issuer
    participant B as Browser (User)
    participant E as Browser Extension
    participant C as Client Helper
    participant S as Setup Service
    B->>I: visit login page, enters username/password
    I-->>B: redirect to welcome page
    B->>I: click "Issue JWT" button
    I->>I: create, sign and return JWT
    I->>E: read JWT from <meta> tag
    E->>C: post {JWT, schema_UID, issuer_URL} to /prepare
    C->>E: return cred_UID
    par Client Helper prepares the cred for showing
        C->>S: fetch Crescent prove params from /prove_params/<schema_UID>
        C->>S: fetch Crescent show params from /show_params/<schema_UID>
        C->>I: fetch JWK set from <issuer_URL>/.well-known/jwks.json
        C->>C: prepare JWT for proof
    and Browser Extension pings Client Helper until credential is ready
        loop Every 5 sec
            E->>C: fetch credential status from /status?cred_uid=<cred_UID>
            C->>E: return state
            E->>E: mark JWT as presentable when state = "ready"
        end
    end
```

## Credential deletion

The following diagram illustrates the the credential deletion sequence.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant E as Browser Extension
    participant C as Client Helper
    E->>E: user selects a credential to delete (identified by <cred_UID>)
    E->>C: fetch /delete/?cred_uid=<cred_UID>
```


## Proof presentation

The following diagram illustrates the proof presentation sequence.

    participant B as Browser (User)
    participant E as Browser Extension
    participant C as Client Helper
    participant S as Setup Service
    participant V as Verifier
    participant I as Issuer
    B->>V: visit login page
    V->>E: read {disclosure_UID, verify_URL} from <meta> tag
    E->>E: filter JWT that support disclosure_UID
    B->>E: user selects a JWT to present
    E->>C: fetch show proof from /show?cred_uid=<cred_UID>&disc_uid=<disclosure_UID>
    C->>C: generate Crescent proof
    C->>E: return proof
    E->>V: post {proof, schema_UID, issuer_UID} to verify_URL
    V->>S: fetch Crescent verify params from /verify_params/<schema_UID>
    V->>I: fetch JWK set from <issuer_URL>/.well-known/jwks.json
    V->>V: verify proof
    V-->>B: redirect to resource page (on success)
```
