# Sample Client Helper
 
This folder contains a sample Client Helper. This is a server that can be deployed locally or as a web service that the browser extension uses to offload expensive computations and storage. 

## Setup

## Running the server

To start the server, run `cargo run`. By default, the server will listen on `http://localhost:8003`; this can be modified by changing the `port` variable in the [Rocket.toml](./Rocket.toml) file.
