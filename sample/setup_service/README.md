# Sample Setup Service
 
This folder contains a sample Crescent Setup Server. This entity sets up the ZK parameters used by all users and verifiers working with JWTs sharing the same schema.

## Setup

The Crescent library must have been built and the ZK setup must have been run before setting up the server, specifically:
* From `../../setup/scripts`, run `./run_setup.sh rs256`, and 
* From `../../creds`, run `cargo run --bin crescent --release --features print-trace zksetup --name rs256`

 ***NOTE: the instructions below are not currently valid. The current setup directly uses the sample files in the parent Crescent folders. This might change in the future, so keeping this text until we land the code.***
```
The server uses a JWT to generate the ZK parameters. An input JWT can be provided (coming from a collaborating issuer or a bootstrapping user); otherwise, a dummy JWT (with dummy attribute and signature values) can be used, as long as it matches the schema used by issuers. To set up the server, run `./scripts/setup-service.sh [JWT_path] [params_UID]` passing an optional JWT path (if absent, a dummy one will be generated and used) and an optional parameters UID (if absent, a random one will be used). The ZK parameters will be make available 
```

## Running the server

To start the server, run `cargo run --release`. By default, the server will listen on `http://localhost:8002`; this can be modified by changing the `port` variable in the [Rocket.toml](./Rocket.toml) file.

## Testing the server

To test the server, run `cargo test --release`.
